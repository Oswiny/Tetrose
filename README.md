As of now i would say it's playable but incomplete as this is only alpha.

Some things that i know are missing/ should be added / should be done:

-Sound System

-Effects

-Checking each script line by line (there are a lot of unnecesarry things that can be taken out and optimized)

-Saving Scores After Game Closing

-Probably some "focus" power

-Better UI

-Ability To Change Themes (color of pieces)

-A few more game modes

-Ability To Change Keybinds

-Countdown before starting a game

-A better gravity system

-...
